  In <i>Jane Eyre</i>, by Charlotte Brontë, liberty and servitude are not mutually exclusive.
  Though Jane, when dissatisfied with the closed world of Lowood, decides that liberty is too great an aspiration
  for her and seeks instead “a new servitude,” her desire for liberty is not irreconcilable with her situation.
  Regardless of their station in life, servitude is an unescapable condition for the characters in the novel,
  whether in the form of employment, devotion to religion, or love and marriage,
  and not all servitude is pleasant or acceptable to Jane.
  In the case of St. John, she cannot accompany him on his mission to India
  without succumbing to his repressive influence, and losing control over her life;
  indeed, she remarks specifically that she “did not love [her] servitude” (Brontë 398).
  But just as certain servitude can strip away liberty, it is in the condition of servitude that Jane,
  and all other characters must attain the liberty they desire.
</p>

<p>
  The problem that follows is how to best characterize the liberty which Jane desires.
  This liberty cannot be freedom from servitude. All characters in the novel, regardless of their position in society,
  are bound to service of some sort; the most obvious are the servants present in every house,
  but Jane, through her employments as schoolteacher and governess,
  works toward providing the children she teaches with an education, and renders them and her employers a service.
  St. John, through his mission abroad to spiritually uplift the colonial subjects of British India,
  works to serve the cause of his religion, and indirectly, to sate his own passion and ambitious nature.
  Even Mr. Rochester, as he flew across Europe in his youth, leaving behind and renouncing his ties of marriage
  to Bertha Mason, his connections in society, and even his duty to religion,
  thinking that he had done “all that God and humanity [required of him],”
  was still servant to his own passion (Brontë 309).
  On the continent, he sought “a good and intelligent woman, whom [he] could love,”
  and when he did not find one, determined that he “could not live alone,”
  and took up mistresses to fulfill his need (Brontë 310-311).
</p>

<p>
  So if liberty through freedom from servitude is unattainable,
  perhaps liberty in <i>Jane Eyre</i> can better be defined, at least in the context of employment,
  in terms of the degree of autonomy which characters are allowed in their servitude.
  While Jane taught at Lowood, she was required to adhere to the schedule of the school,
  and teach to standards set for her by others. Perhaps, then, it stands to reason that after a time,
  she would have wanted to venture out into the wider world, and pursue a more fulfilling occupation (Brontë 84).
  As Adele’s governess at Thornfield, Jane was allowed to decide her hours of work and the content of her pupil’s
  instruction. She was given the library, and for the most part, left to her own devices,
  though occasionally her work and the progression of her student would come into public view
  and scrutiny (Brontë 103).
  Furthermore, her employer, Mrs. Fairfax approached Jane and treated her as if they were equals,
  and upon Mrs. Fairfax’s revelation that they both were subordinate to Mr. Rochester,
  Jane delights that “the equality between [the two of them] was real;
  not the mere result of condescension on her part” (Brontë 100).
</p>

<p>
  Yet autonomy in her work does not seem to comprise the entirety of Jane’s desire for liberty, for, at Morton,
  Jane had the greatest freedom in her work, left entirely in charge in the education of the working-class children.
  There were few expectations for the children’s improvement placed upon her,
  and any gains in their capabilities would be the result of Jane’s exertions,
  rather than as any requirement in her duties. So how is it that while taking on this task, she remarks,
  “much enjoyment I do not expect in the life opening before me” (Brontë 359)?
  Upon closer examination, there are greater similarities between Jane’s situation at the Morton School
  and her position as a teacher at Lowood than would be immediately apparent,
  but understanding them requires the consideration of a second, greater desire by Jane.
  During Jane’s formative period as a student at Lowood, her need to be loved by others is revealed,
  as she confides to Helen burns, saying “I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough:
  if others don’t love me, I would rather die than live – I cannot bear to be solitary and hated, Helen” (Brontë 69).
  This need for love from others, perhaps, was another factor in Jane’s departure from Lowood.
</p>

<p>
  The immediate trigger for Jane’s dissatisfaction with her life at Lowood was when Miss Temple,
  the superintendent of the school, left Lowood after marriage. Jane had formed a close personal relationship with her,
  as Miss Temple had been one of her favored teachers in her childhood,
  and now one of her most familiar acquaintances over eight years;
  Jane states that “to her instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements;
  her friendship and society had been my continued solace; she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess,
  and latterly, companion” (Brontë 84).
  In the absence of Miss Temple, Jane no longer had a fulfilling relationship through which to abide,
  and feels the need to seek in the world people and experiences which can fulfill her need for love.
  At Morton, Jane had just fled from her first, failed engagement with Rochester,
  after the revelation of his marriage to Bertha Mason,
  and though she was tempted to go and live with him as his mistress,
  saying “There was a heaven – a temporary heaven … if I chose,”
  she could not tolerate living with Rochester as his mistress, and not his wife (Brontë 320).
  Now again, at Morton, her need for love goes unfulfilled, and she cannot feel free through her employment alone.
</p>

<p>
  Not all servitude, then, is solely for the benefit of others. Rochester, after forsaking God, country, and society,
  served only his own desires as he traversed the European continent alone, without obligations.
  St. John, too is a passionate character, though he presents to the world a restrained façade.
  Though he is able to dismiss his love for Rosamond Oliver as “but a love of the senses,”
  and ask Jane to embark with him to India in a loveless marriage, his ambition does not go abated (Brontë 392).
  He will not indulge himself in his romantic feelings,
  nor in the money inherited from John Eyre which Jane insists on splitting equally with her cousins,
  but through the dedication of his life to the missionary cause, he finds a release for the needs of his ambition,
  and pursues it with the full intensity of his passion, intent on
  “being numbered in the band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their race” (Brontë 374).
  Jane as well, though she states that “any one may serve,” she,
  too must serve herself when it comes to the fulfillment of her needs (Brontë 86).
</p>

<p>
  Love, then, is another of Jane’s servitudes, though liberty in the context of love and interpersonal
  relationships is more difficult to define than that in the context of employment.
  Though in her first engagement to Rochester, Jane was loved, and had her need for love fulfilled,
  the inequality in their positions was a constant source of anxiety for Jane;
  when Rochester first proposes marriage to Jane, Mrs. Fairfax, unaware of what had just transpired,
  sees the two of them kiss (Brontë 256). Though Rochester, amused, asks,
  “Did she think, Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?” Jane is concerned,
  and says that Mrs. Fairfax “thought that [Jane] had forgotten [her] station,” remembering the divide in wealth,
  connections, and background between her and Rochester (Brontë 263). Despite the love between her and Rochester,
  it was a struggle for Jane to reconcile the imbalance in their social standings.
  The difficulty only increases when the wedding is halted, and the existence of Bertha Mason exposed;
  were Jane to stay with Rochester and become his mistress rather than his wife, Rochester, then,
  would wield all the power in their relationship, and have power over her.
</p>

<p>
  However, equality in monetary worth and social standing alone do not provide for liberty in a relationship.
  St. John is Jane’s cousin, and by extension, is from much the same background as her.
  Jane has split the fortune of her uncle, John Eyre, equally between her and her three cousins,
  and Jane and St. John are on equal terms of wealth.
  But when St. John asks Jane to marry him and accompany and assist him on his mission to India,
  the prospect is unacceptable to her, and she will not marry him,
  stating that “we did not love each other as man and wife should;
  and therefore it inferred we ought not to marry” (Brontë 405).
  She does at consent to go if he will allow her to remain free, though, but this too is unsuitable for Jane.
  Diana states that Jane “would not live three months there” (Brontë 415). Jane too believes that if she goes to India,
  she “[goes] to premature death,” and it is a death that she brings upon herself,
  unable to refuse anything which St. John asks of her (Brontë 404).
  She cannot thrive in this relationship, both because of the absence of love,
  and because of St. John’s irresistible, persuasive, and coercive influence on her.
</p>

<p>
  Liberty, in a broad context, then, perhaps can be best characterized as freedom from the repression
  of the greatest of a character’s needs. St. John can sacrifice the needs of his body, his prospects for romance,
  and more for his great ambition and desire to work greatness.
  Rochester, in his search across the continent for a woman whom he can truly love in the place of Bertha Mason
  and the madness from which he fled, can sacrifice his sight and the use of his right hand, when he has found Jane.
  Though it is not directly through his actions, as Jane leaves, he says to her,
  “No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall, yourself, pluck out your right eye;
  yourself cut off your right hand; your heart shall be the victim; and you, the priest, to transfix it” (Brontë 297).
  These words mirror instead his own fate; in being rid of Bertha, he becomes maimed and blind,
  but finally is able to regain his relationship with Jane.
  Jane, though through discovering her familial ties with Mary and Diana Rivers and St. John,
  is able to experience familial love, St. John places her into the position of accepting an offer
  that will only lead her to her demise. While away from Rochester, Jane is repressed in her need for love,
  and though she refers to her work at Morton School as “[days] passed in honorable exertion amongst [her] scholars,”
  it cannot sustain her, and she must return to Rochester (Brontë 366).
</p>

<p>
  Even so, in her second engagement and final marriage with Rochester,
  there is sacrifice in the fulfillment of her one great need,
  as there is in all characters’ satisfaction of their one great need. Jane describes her marriage,
  ten years later, as her “[living] entirely for and with what [she loves] best on earth” (Brontë 450).
  She must devote her time to taking care of her husband, a blind man, and though not ruined in wealth,
  diminished with the destruction of Thornfield Hall.
  But “never did [she] weary of conducting [Rochester] where he wished to go:
  of doing for him what he wished to be done,” because though the sacrifices of other freedoms are made,
  she is freed through her servitude to Rochester from the repression of her need for love; she is not coerced,
  as she was in the case of St. John, into a futile and loveless servitude.
  The exigency for this one great liberty overtakes all other needs, and in her servitude to Rochester,
  Jane is able at last to attain the liberty which she has desired throughout the novel.
</p>

<p>
  Though the fact that Jane can only achieve liberty in a condition of servitude to a man who can become her equal
  only after becoming blinded, maimed, and diminished in estate, perhaps attests to the repressiveness of
  <i>Jane Eyre</i> as a novel, her journey throughout the bildungsroman is, in essence, encompassed by her
  transitions between servitude to servitude. Ultimately, at the core of her final servitude is the reconciliation
  of her need for love from others with her position of servitude to others.
  For Rochester, too, their marriage too deals with his great need of finding a woman whom he could truly
  love at last. St. John, too, is brought up at the end, as “his glorious sun hastens to its setting.”
  His ambition satisfied, he is content with death, and his expectation of eternal beatitude (Brontë 452).
  With the ending, all of them have achieved liberty as they desired it.
