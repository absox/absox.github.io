  In <i>Jane Eyre</i>, by Charlotte Brontë, liberty and servitude are not mutually exclusive. Though Jane, when
  dissatisfied with the closed world of Lowood, decides that liberty is too great an aspiration for her and seeks
  instead “a new servitude,” her desire for liberty is not irreconcilable with her situation. Regardless of their
  station in life, servitude is an unescapable condition for the characters in the novel, whether in the form of
  employment, devotion to religion, or love and marriage, and not all servitude is pleasant or acceptable to Jane. In
  the case of St. John, she cannot accompany him on his mission to India without succumbing to his repressive influence,
  and losing control over her life; indeed, she remarks specifically that she “did not love [her] servitude” (Brontë
  398). But just as certain servitude can strip away liberty, it is in the condition of servitude that Jane, and all
  other characters must attain the liberty they desire.
</p>

<p>
  The problem that follows is how to best characterize the liberty which Jane desires. This liberty cannot be freedom
  from servitude. All characters in the novel, regardless of their position in society, are bound to service of some
  sort; the most obvious are the servants present in every house, but Jane, through her employments as schoolteacher and
  governess, works toward providing the children she teaches with an education, and renders them and her employers a
  service. St. John, through his mission abroad to spiritually uplift the colonial subjects of British India, works to
  serve the cause of his religion, and indirectly, to sate his own passion and ambitious nature. Even Mr. Rochester, as
  he flew across Europe in his youth, leaving behind and renouncing his ties of marriage to Bertha Mason, his
  connections in society, and even his duty to religion, thinking that he had done “all that God and humanity [required
  of him],” was still servant to his own passion (Brontë 309). On the continent, he sought “a good and intelligent
  woman, whom [he] could love,” and when he did not find one, determined that he “could not live alone,” and took up
  mistresses to fulfill his need (Brontë 310-311).
</p>

<p>
  So if liberty through freedom from servitude is unattainable, perhaps liberty in <i>Jane Eyre</i> can better be
  defined, at least in the context of employment, in terms of the degree of autonomy which characters are allowed in
  their servitude. While Jane taught at Lowood, she was required to adhere to the schedule of the school, and teach to
  standards set for her by others. Perhaps, then, it stands to reason that after a time, she would have wanted to
  venture out into the wider world, and pursue a more fulfilling occupation (Brontë 84). As Adele’s governess at
  Thornfield, Jane was allowed to decide her hours of work and the content of her pupil’s instruction. She was given the
  library, and for the most part, left to her own devices, though occasionally her work and the progression of her
  student would come into public view and scrutiny (Brontë 103). Furthermore, her employer, Mrs. Fairfax approached Jane
  and treated her as if they were equals, and upon Mrs. Fairfax’s revelation that they both were subordinate to Mr.
  Rochester, Jane delights that “the equality between [the two of them] was real; not the mere result of condescension
  on her part” (Brontë 100).
</p>

<p>
  Yet autonomy in her work does not seem to comprise the entirety of Jane’s desire for liberty, for, at Morton, Jane had
  the greatest freedom in her work, left entirely in charge in the education of the working-class children. There were
  few expectations for the children’s improvement placed upon her, and any gains in their capabilities would be the
  result of Jane’s exertions, rather than as any requirement in her duties. So how is it that while taking on this task,
  she remarks, “much enjoyment I do not expect in the life opening before me” (Brontë 359)? Upon closer examination,
  there are greater similarities between Jane’s situation at the Morton School and her position as a teacher at Lowood
  than would be immediately apparent, but understanding them requires the consideration of a second, greater desire by
  Jane. During Jane’s formative period as a student at Lowood, her need to be loved by others is revealed, as she
  confides to Helen burns, saying “I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if others don’t love
  me, I would rather die than live – I cannot bear to be solitary and hated, Helen” (Brontë 69). This need for love from
  others, perhaps, was another factor in Jane’s departure from Lowood.
</p>

<p>
  The immediate trigger for Jane’s dissatisfaction with her life at Lowood was when Miss Temple, the superintendent of
  the school, left Lowood after marriage. Jane had formed a close personal relationship with her, as Miss Temple had
  been one of her favored teachers in her childhood, and now one of her most familiar acquaintances over eight years;
  Jane states that “to her instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements; her friendship and society had been my
  continued solace; she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and latterly, companion” (Brontë 84). In the
  absence of Miss Temple, Jane no longer had a fulfilling relationship through which to abide, and feels the need to
  seek in the world people and experiences which can fulfill her need for love. At Morton, Jane had just fled from her
  first, failed engagement with Rochester, after the revelation of his marriage to Bertha Mason, and though she was
  tempted to go and live with him as his mistress, saying “There was a heaven – a temporary heaven … if I chose,” she
  could not tolerate living with Rochester as his mistress, and not his wife (Brontë 320). Now again, at Morton, her
  need for love goes unfulfilled, and she cannot feel free through her employment alone.
</p>

<p>
  Not all servitude, then, is solely for the benefit of others. Rochester, after forsaking God, country, and society,
  served only his own desires as he traversed the European continent alone, without obligations. St. John, too is a
  passionate character, though he presents to the world a restrained façade. Though he is able to dismiss his love for
  Rosamond Oliver as “but a love of the senses,” and ask Jane to embark with him to India in a loveless marriage, his
  ambition does not go abated (Brontë 392). He will not indulge himself in his romantic feelings, nor in the money
  inherited from John Eyre which Jane insists on splitting equally with her cousins, but through the dedication of his
  life to the missionary cause, he finds a release for the needs of his ambition, and pursues it with the full intensity
  of his passion, intent on “being numbered in the band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering
  their race” (Brontë 374). Jane as well, though she states that “any one may serve,” she, too must serve herself when
  it comes to the fulfillment of her needs (Brontë 86).
</p>

<p>
  Love, then, is another of Jane’s servitudes, though liberty in the context of love and interpersonal relationships is
  more difficult to define than that in the context of employment. Though in her first engagement to Rochester, Jane was
  loved, and had her need for love fulfilled, the inequality in their positions was a constant source of anxiety for
  Jane; when Rochester first proposes marriage to Jane, Mrs. Fairfax, unaware of what had just transpired, sees the two
  of them kiss (Brontë 256). Though Rochester, amused, asks, “Did she think, Janet, you had given the world for love,
  and considered it well lost?” Jane is concerned, and says that Mrs. Fairfax “thought that [Jane] had forgotten [her]
  station,” remembering the divide in wealth, connections, and background between her and Rochester (Brontë 263).
  Despite the love between her and Rochester, it was a struggle for Jane to reconcile the imbalance in their social
  standings. The difficulty only increases when the wedding is halted, and the existence of Bertha Mason exposed; were
  Jane to stay with Rochester and become his mistress rather than his wife, Rochester, then, would wield all the power
  in their relationship, and have power over her.
</p>

<p>
  However, equality in monetary worth and social standing alone do not provide for liberty in a relationship. St. John
  is Jane’s cousin, and by extension, is from much the same background as her. Jane has split the fortune of her uncle,
  John Eyre, equally between her and her three cousins, and Jane and St. John are on equal terms of wealth. But when St.
  John asks Jane to marry him and accompany and assist him on his mission to India, the prospect is unacceptable to her,
  and she will not marry him, stating that “we did not love each other as man and wife should; and therefore it inferred
  we ought not to marry” (Brontë 405). She does at consent to go if he will allow her to remain free, though, but this
  too is unsuitable for Jane. Diana states that Jane “would not live three months there” (Brontë 415). Jane too believes
  that if she goes to India, she “[goes] to premature death,” and it is a death that she brings upon herself, unable to
  refuse anything which St. John asks of her (Brontë 404). She cannot thrive in this relationship, both because of the
  absence of love, and because of St. John’s irresistible, persuasive, and coercive influence on her.
</p>

<p>
  Liberty, in a broad context, then, perhaps can be best characterized as freedom from the repression of the greatest of
  a character’s needs. St. John can sacrifice the needs of his body, his prospects for romance, and more for his great
  ambition and desire to work greatness. Rochester, in his search across the continent for a woman whom he can truly
  love in the place of Bertha Mason and the madness from which he fled, can sacrifice his sight and the use of his right
  hand, when he has found Jane. Though it is not directly through his actions, as Jane leaves, he says to her, “No; you
  shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall, yourself, pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your
  right hand; your heart shall be the victim; and you, the priest, to transfix it” (Brontë 297). These words mirror
  instead his own fate; in being rid of Bertha, he becomes maimed and blind, but finally is able to regain his
  relationship with Jane. Jane, though through discovering her familial ties with Mary and Diana Rivers and St. John, is
  able to experience familial love, St. John places her into the position of accepting an offer that will only lead her
  to her demise. While away from Rochester, Jane is repressed in her need for love, and though she refers to her work at
  Morton School as “[days] passed in honorable exertion amongst [her] scholars,” it cannot sustain her, and she must
  return to Rochester (Brontë 366).
</p>

<p>
  Even so, in her second engagement and final marriage with Rochester, there is sacrifice in the fulfillment of her one
  great need, as there is in all characters’ satisfaction of their one great need. Jane describes her marriage, ten
  years later, as her “[living] entirely for and with what [she loves] best on earth” (Brontë 450). She must devote her
  time to taking care of her husband, a blind man, and though not ruined in wealth, diminished with the destruction of
  Thornfield Hall. But “never did [she] weary of conducting [Rochester] where he wished to go: of doing for him what he
  wished to be done,” because though the sacrifices of other freedoms are made, she is freed through her servitude to
  Rochester from the repression of her need for love; she is not coerced, as she was in the case of St. John, into a
  futile and loveless servitude. The exigency for this one great liberty overtakes all other needs, and in her servitude
  to Rochester, Jane is able at last to attain the liberty which she has desired throughout the novel.
</p>

<p>
  Though the fact that Jane can only achieve liberty in a condition of servitude to a man who can become her equal only
  after becoming blinded, maimed, and diminished in estate, perhaps attests to the repressiveness of <i>Jane Eyre</i> as
  a novel, her journey throughout the bildungsroman is, in essence, encompassed by her transitions between servitude to
  servitude. Ultimately, at the core of her final servitude is the reconciliation of her need for love from others with
  her position of servitude to others. For Rochester, too, their marriage too deals with his great need of finding a
  woman whom he could truly love at last. St. John, too, is brought up at the end, as “his glorious sun hastens to its
  setting.” His ambition satisfied, he is content with death, and his expectation of eternal beatitude (Brontë 452).
  With the ending, all of them have achieved liberty as they desired it.
