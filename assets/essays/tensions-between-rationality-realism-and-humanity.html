  <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_fiction" target="_blank">Rationalist fiction</a>, and to a lesser
  extent, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic" target="_blank">rational fiction</a>,
  empowers its reader. We, the audience, live vicariously
  through the characters of these narratives as they face the insurmountable and prevail, armed only with their
  knowledge and capacity for logical reasoning. The best stories in the genre not only stand up to careful scrutiny
  but encourage it; during its original weekly online publication, Eliezer Yudkowsky’s
  <i><a href="http://www.hpmor.com" target="_blank">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a> (HPMOR)</i>, just before
  its conclusion, issued its readers a “<a href="http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/113" target="_blank">final exam</a>”: the
  readership was to deduce how Harry could escape his predicament, naked, wandless, and surrounded by Voldemort and his
  Death Eaters. If no suitable solution was sent to the author within 60 hours, the story would end there with Harry’s
  death. Yet whatever the perceived difficulty of the task at hand, in rationalist fiction, the hero almost invariably
  succeeds in achieving his aims. Rationalist fiction is didactic by construction, ideally teaching some aspect of
  rationality to its reader. Yet in practice, the overwhelmingly triumphant message which it conveys – <i>through the power
  of the scientific method, the true nature of any phenomenon can be understood; through the power of rational thinking,
  nothing is impossible</i> – is too facile. Victory comes cheaply for the rationalist hero, often without any true
  concessions. In rationalist fiction, even death can be impermanent and thus immaterial, as Hermione, who in <i>HPMOR</i>
  dies during the troll attack, is promptly resurrected. <i>HPMOR</i>’s Dumbledore is trapped outside of time by the
  Mirror of Notilov, but not lost forever with certainty. This lack of material consequence undermines the weight of the
  narrative, and thus the weight of the lessons which it seeks to teach. Moreover, the rationalist hero is seldom wrong;
  there are very few, if any rationalist narratives in which the hero has to accept any compromise of his values or
  change his beliefs. An integral part of rational thinking is the ability to change one’s mind when wrong; statements
  such as, “what can be destroyed by the truth ought to be,” have become rallying cries for the rationalist fiction
  community. But to neglect the true cost or difficulty of victory, and to neglect the possibility that one’s foregone
  conclusions may be wrong, proves an equal neglect of the truth.

  Perhaps it’s an enduring human quality to be blind to our own shortcomings, or at least more forgiving of our own
  faults those of others. The planning fallacy is a pervasive optimistic bias where individuals systematically
  underestimate the time necessary to complete tasks (Kahneman et al. 1979). Yet this optimistic bias does not extend to
  other people; when asked to estimate task completion times for other people, we tend towards pessimism, overestimating
  the time required (Buehler et al. 2002). In a similar manner, <i>HPMOR</i>’s Harry systematically overestimates his
  own abilities, and underestimates that of others: he fails to take the Dark Lord seriously (in Chapter 86, he tells
  Snape and Dumbledore that he imagines that he’s smarter than Voldemort), and thus doesn’t realize Quirrell’s
  true identity until it’s too late; he underestimates Dumbledore and mistrusts his guidance as a result. During the
  Ministry debacle, when Harry is forced to choose between Hermione’s freedom and paying Lucius Malfoy one hundred
  thousand galleons, Dumbledore tells Harry that “there can be only one king upon the chessboard” (Chapter 82).
  Dumbledore himself had been forced to value the life of his brother against paying a ransom of one hundred thousand
  galleons, all that the Order of the Phoenix had in their war chest, during the war against Voldemort. Yet paying the
  ransom would only invite future hostage situations, and thus Dumbledore must prove, “the only way that it can be
  proven, that [he is] no longer willing to pay such prices” (Chapter 82).

  Dumbledore’s chess metaphor is apt on many levels. Chess, when played by two players of comparable skill, is a game
  of continual tradeoffs. Move after move, players have to value different advantages and weaknesses against one
  another: whether it’s worth it or not to sacrifice material for an attack on the opposing king, to give up the
  initiative in order to capture an unprotected pawn, or to sacrifice a solid pawn structure in order to speed up
  development. Expert-level players will generally be able to identify in their calculations many of the same important
  candidate moves as a master, but a master-caliber player will be more consistent in choosing the best option from
  among these candidates. Though both players start at rough equality (with slightly better winning chances for white,
  as the initiative of moving first is worth about a quarter-pawn), over the course of many moves, small advantages
  may accumulate until one player can convert his advantage into a victory. Chess is a game of victory at all costs.
  No matter how great of a material advantage is gained or lost, the game ends when the king is checkmated. A victory
  without struggle is only possible against lesser opponents; Harry’s refusal to play by these standards is tantamount
  to his refusal to acknowledge Voldemort, Dumbledore, and Lucius Malfoy as his equals in ability. Dumbledore himself
  states it best: “Phoenixes are not arrogant. They know the limits of their own wisdom. Unlike you, Harry” (Chapter 82).

  <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17405/17405-h/17405-h.htm" target="_blank"><i>The Art of War</i></a> states,
  “The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death. Therefore, it is a matter
  which must be regarded with the utmost seriousness.” Failure to observe this tenet has resulted in military disaster
  many times throughout history. At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pharsalus" target="_blank">Pharsalus</a>
  in 48 BC, Pompey Magnus faced Julius Caesar; Pompey’s forces were well-supplied, had cavalry superiority, and
  outnumbered Caesar’s 2 to 1. Caesar was cut off from reinforcement, resupply, and escape, and thus Pompey needed only
  to delay, and starve the Caesarian forces into surrender. Yet urged by his sub-commanders to seek glory, rather than
  a bloodless victory, Pompey gave battle, and was utterly defeated in the ensuing battle. In <i>HPMOR</i>, Dumbledore
  constantly urges Harry not to take the enemy lightly; he seeks to prepare Harry to fight the same type of war against
  the Dark Lord: one in which Harry, too, would have to constantly weigh the lives of his friends against the greater
  good. Yet not only are there no enduring consequences suffered for Harry’s mistakes, as he proceeds to vanquish
  Quirrell/Voldemort in short order, there is never any moment in which Harry must weigh two difficult decisions against
  one another; his “rationality” is never put to the test. His refusal to compromise and accept the wisdom of others is
  portrayed as strength, rather than weakness.
</p>
<p>
  No fiction is perfect, and despite its faults, <i>HPMOR</i> is still a wonderfully engaging narrative. Yet its
  pedagogy is heavily flawed and oversimplified at best. The methods of rationality in reality do not yield bloodless
  miracles; in science, our hypotheses are more often wrong than right (Edison’s somewhat-apocryphal ten thousand
  attempts to produce a working lightbulb come to mind). Even if <i>HPMOR</i>’s view of rational decision-making as a
  simple optimization over Bayesian estimates of expected utility were correct, huge classes of optimization problems
  are provably infeasible to compute solutions for in any practical amount of time. Scientific progress does not occur
  in a sixty second period where one must “shut up and multiply,” but incrementally, over the span of years or
  lifetimes. Nor is it wise to flippantly disregard the findings of others, as Harry does repeatedly with Dumbledore;
  as Sir Isaac Newton wrote, “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” Failing to
  acknowledge these shortcomings is not only detrimental for the genre, and the art of narrative craft in general,
  but is a failure to acknowledge reality.

  In sidestepping the difficult choices, we miss the opportunity to examine an important aspect of rationality: that
  there is tension between humanity and rationality that makes the pursuit of rationality difficult; to struggle with
  rationality and choices that must be made in spite of intuitive or moral misgivings is part of what is essentially
  human. <i>HPMOR</i> very briefly considers one such choice: Voldemort offers to spare Lily if she leaves Harry to die.
  Perhaps, if we strictly consider this choice from the perspective of expected utility, this is the correct choice:
  she has no means to resist him; to leave is to live, even if it means abandoning her son, but to stay is to meet
  certain death. There may be other scenarios in which the rational decision is one which ordinary people cannot bear
  to make. After some reflection, Harry merely says, “but human beings can’t live like that,” and the story never again
  picks up the thread (Chapter 82). <i>HPMOR</i> gets very close to considering the idea that the blind application of
  instrumental rationality is itself dehumanizing, yet never quite gets there. But when victory comes without cost,
  and there’s no need for our heroes to realize their mistakes, or change their minds when they’re wrong, we miss the
  opportunity to question whether or not our goals are worth achieving in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  Crafting quality narrative is by itself already a difficult endeavor. A thorough exploration of rationality on the
  scope of <i>HPMOR</i> is a vastly ambitious undertaking, and a myriad of factors make it unlikely that another such
  work will appear. Yet just as in science, this progress need not come all at once. A more balanced treatment of
  certain aspects of rationality, if not rationality as a whole, could lead to interesting opportunities for narrative.
  If one of the goals of rationalist fiction is to be taken seriously as didactic, then these issues, and the
  complexities that arise from them, deserve our attention.
