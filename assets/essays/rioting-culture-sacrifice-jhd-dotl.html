  In <i>John Henry Days</i>, culture is something which demands sacrifice. Dave Brown describes the death of Meredith
  Hunter at the hands of the Hell’s Angels as a “[sacrifice] to the culture. The kids had brought a new thing into the
  world, but they hadn’t paid for it yet. It had to be paid for” (Whitehead 99). In all, there are three such sacrifices
  that “[bring] a new thing into the world” in the novel: the deaths of John Henry, Meredith Hunter, and J. Sutter
  create narratives which are told and retold; through their deaths, a part of literary and oral culture is created. Yet
  it is not merely their lives that are ultimately sacrificed, but a part of meaningfulness as well. This downward
  spiral towards increasing meaninglessness can be observed in the increasingly ephemeral nature of the narratives which
  they create: though John Henry is the first to die, his legacy endures through folk songs and the novel’s titular
  festival. Hunter’s death becomes the centerpiece of a chapter in Dave Brown’s memoir, Rock and Roll Memories
  (Whitehead 91). J’s death and the John Henry Days shootings are documented in a news article, and is ultimately
  “bumped from the front pages” by the obituary of a famous actor (Whitehead 366). A similar kind of two-fold sacrifice
  occurs in <i>The Day of the Locust</i>. Though Tod is not the one to die in the Los Angeles riot, his authenticity and
  ability to distinguish between reality and facades are lost. There is a second kind of loss associated with this, too:
  as a Yale-educated artist, Tod represents a kind of visionary presence of literature and art within culture. As he
  accepts a ride home from the police in the aftermath of the riot, he finds himself unable to distinguish his own voice
  from that of the police car’s siren, and ultimately “[begins] to imitate the siren as loud as he could” (West 167). In
  both novels, scenes of riot culminate in the sacrifice not simply of human life, but of meaningfulness and
  authenticity in a way that suggests a culture that causes the continued and inevitable diminishing of the value of
  these sacrifices.

  Dave Brown recalls to the junketeers how “in the days after the concert, people kept mentioning that four people died
  and four babies were born, as if that was some kind of equation that balanced all the negativity out. But it didn’t”
  (Whitehead 95). Each sacrifice is an example of this kind of uneven exchange: in exchange for a human life, a
  narrative is created, written, and retold. When the Chicago Defender seeks information on John Henry, dozens of people
  write to the editor with different versions of the folk tale (Whitehead 3-6). The promulgation of these stories and
  folk songs are the direct result of his death, yet they are not equal to the individual who has been lost in the
  process. The different stories conflict with one another on even the most basic of details such as when or where he
  lived, the color of his skin, the manner of his death, or if he was ever even a real person, as one letter reads, “I
  think this John Henry stuff is just a tale someone started. My father worked for the Burleigh Drill Company and told
  me for a fact that no steam drill was ever used in the Big Bend Tunnel. He was a salesman for Burleigh” (Whitehead 5).
  In place of a singular individual with concrete form and character, the stories of John Henry form a fractured image
  that casts doubt on the very possibility of existence.
</p>

<p>
  As for Meredith Hunter, Dave Brown does not even make the attempt to relate the details of Hunter’s life in his
  retelling. The story only manages to convey that he was black, wore a lime green suit and black shirt, had an afro,
  and was killed by the Hell’s Angels after he pulled a gun on one who grabbed his hair (Whitehead 97-99). In the
  conversation between the two postal workers, J is merely mentioned in passing as a journalist and bystander who was
  killed by a policeman trying to avert a shooting (Whitehead 370). Indeed, even the newspapers fragment the story of
  his death, not only by placing emphasis on his killer, Alphonse Miggs, but in the fact that the initial publications
  are mistaken in the details which they report; the postal workers are relieved that “[at] least he wasn’t one of ours.
  The first reports said he was one of us” (Whitehead 369). The rest of the details of their lives are lost, just as
  they are for John Henry; the creation of the stories do not balance out their deaths.
</p>

<p>
  Though the three sacrifices are perhaps equal in the inequality of their exchanges of narratives for human lives,
  there are disconcerting and conflicting trends between them. The chronology of John Henry, Meredith Hunter, and J
  Sutter is clearly linear, each separated from the others by decades. The passage of time erodes the memories which
  hold their stories, and thus, because Sutter’s death is more recent than Hunter’s, which is in turn more recent than
  John Henry’s, it is possible to know the details of what transpired in his life more accurately than those of the
  others. The forms which their stories take reflects this trend: J’s death is reported in a newspaper article, a form
  that ostensibly reports on the facts in a manner which is objective, clear, and concise. Dave Brown’s memoir lacks the
  credibility of news reporting, and the folk tales of John Henry are the least trustworthy of all as a source of
  information. Furthermore, while the folk tales are merely hearsay, Dave Brown was present at Meredith Hunter’s death,
  though it occurred over thirty years before the events novel, and the postal worker speaking to the colleague at the M
  Street bar in Washington, DC was at the scene of the shooting the very same day.
</p>

<p>
  But while the trend of the narratives is towards increasing temporal and physical proximity to the individuals they
  were exchanged for, the relation between the stories and those who retell and those who act as audiences for them
  trends towards increasing distance. Each writer to the Chicago Defender seems certain that his or her own version is
  the definitive truth about John Henry; one even claims to have known John Henry personally, beginning his letter with,
  “the last time I saw John Henry, who was called Big John Henry, was when a blast fell on him and another Negro”
  (Whitehead 6). John Henry is portrayed as going stoically to meet a fate that seems tragically inevitable in the lines
  of the ballad, “John Henry was just a baby, / When he fell on his mammy’s knee; / He picked up a hammer and a little
  piece of steel, / Said, ‘This hammer will be the death of me, Lord, Lord, / This hammer will be the death of me’”
  (Whitehead 75). He is regarded as a hero of the African-American race and of America, is commemorated on a postal
  stamp, and has a festival held in his honor in Talcott, West Virginia. Dave Brown retells the story of the Stones
  concert with similar certainty.
</p>

<p>
  Though Hunter’s death is not fated in the same way, Dave Brown makes a pun in saying that “the Angels did what the
  people demanded” (Whitehead 99). In this case, the Angels are not divine emissaries or the executors of fate, but are
  instead a motorcycle gang. The junketeers venerate Hunter in a similar fashion, saying, “This guy is like the Crispus
  Attucks of the seventies,” comparing his death to the first death of the American Revolution (Whitehead 99). When
  asked what Hunter’s name was, though, Dave says, “His name? I can’t remember” (Whitehead 99). Sutter, however, is not
  even the focus of the news article that reports on his death. The article focuses instead on Alphonse Miggs, as Joan
  Acorn reports, “Talcott, West Virginia – A postal worker opened fire Sunday afternoon on a crowd of people for the
  unveiling of a new postage stamp, critically wounding three people before being shot and killed” (Whitehead 26). J’s
  death is treated with disinterest by the postal worker who says of the policeman who shot and killed him, “Just doing
  his job, really. Taking out the homicidal madman. Sure he hits two bystanders but that’s his job. Sucks that they’re
  members of the media, for his sake, but he got the guy before he could hurt somebody. Preserving the peace” (Whitehead
  370).
</p>

<p>
  In The Day of the Locust, exchange also occurs, though it is not of narrative and individuals, but between appearances
  and reality, and chaos and control. Facades and imitation are commonplace in the city of Los Angeles, where “Mexican
  ranch houses, Samoan huts, Mediterranean villas, Egyptian and Japanese temples, Swiss chalets, Tudor cottages, and
  every possible combination of these styles … lined the slopes of the canyon” (West 3). Tod notices “that they were all
  of plaster, lath, and paper,” that while they give the impression of these various architectural styles, they are
  internally made of the same cheap materials (West 3). Yet the most salient distinctions to be made are those regarding
  mobs and productions, as those two ingredients are what ultimately combine to form the Los Angeles riot: two separate
  groups of people, one waiting to see Gary Cooper, a Hollywood actor, and a mob that forms to lynch a man who assaulted
  a woman (West 164). Indeed, a similar mingling results in the death of Meredith Hunter; those who are there to enjoy
  the music festival and the Hell’s Angels collide violently, and all attempts at peace-keeping fail.
</p>

<p>
  Tod describes the collision of the two mobs in military language, as if it were the maneuvering of formations and
  soldiers: “He was the spearhead of a flying wedge when it collided with a mass going in the opposite direction” (West
  162). This is an inversion of the opening scene of the novel, when Tod describes the film production of a battle
  scene: “An army of cavalry and foot was passing. It moved like a mob; its lines broken, as though fleeing from some
  terrible defeat. The dolmans of the hussars, the heavy shakos of the guards, Hanoverian light horse, with their flat
  leather caps and flowing red plumes, were all jumbled together in bobbing disorder” (West 1). The film scene is staged
  and choreographed; though it gives the impression of disorderliness and the chaos of battle, everything is in
  actuality held tightly under control by a director, “a little fat man, wearing a cork sun-helmet, polo shirt and
  knickers,” who chases the actors, yelling, “Stage Nine – you bastards – Stage Nine!” (West 1). It is the army who give
  the impression of being a mob, and the mob who give the impression of being an army. Indeed, the mob moves in a
  seemingly concerted fashion against the police: “part of it would surge forward wherever the police line was weakest.
  As soon as that part was rammed back, the bulge would pop out somewhere else” (West 155). The riot, then, produces the
  exchange of the appearance of disorder for the appearance of order, while simultaneously exchanging genuine control
  for genuine chaos.
</p>

<p>
  As for Tod, the riot transforms his painting from visionary to imitation, and assimilates his own character into the
  mob, of which he was once an extrinsic observer. At the outset of the novel, Tod has been in the city for only three
  months, yet is able to pick out at a glance the qualities of people whom he observes on the streets: “The fat lady in
  the yachting cap was going shopping, not boating; the man in the Norfolk jacket and Tyrolean hat was returning, not
  from a mountain, but an insurance office” (West 2). The painting, in a sense, is the manifestation of his judgment
  against the architecture of the city, as he thinks, “But not even the soft wash of dusk could help the houses. Only
  dynamite would be of any use” (West 3). He is not one of the people whom he observes; “they were the people he felt he
  must paint,” and he is the artist (West 2). Yet before he has made his work, the destruction which he envisions
  becomes real in an exchange of imagined violence for real violence in the form of the riot. His final concept for the
  painting includes real people: “For the faces of its members, he was using the innumerable sketches he had made of the
  people who come to California to die” (West 166). Tod not only finds himself in the thick of the mob, but participates
  in the violence, as he “freed his right arm with a heave, reached over the girl and brought his fist down on the man’s
  head” (West 163). Tod’s assimilation is only compounded as he accepts the ride home from the policeman. Tod gives
  Claude’s address instead of his own to the policeman, possibly to leave the impression that he lived in a wealthier
  neighborhood (West 167). Where once he was able to see past the facades that pervaded Los Angeles, by the novel’s end,
  he is unable to distinguish his own voice from the sound of a siren.
</p>

<p>
  The riots in both novels occur quickly and spontaneously upon the collisions which instigate them, yet dissipate
  almost as quickly; in the aftermath of Hunter’s death, Dave Brown recalls, “the Rolling Stones flew away in the
  helicopter and left us in the desert. And we found our way back to our cars and went home” (Whitehead 99). Order seems
  to be the most prevalent state of society, yet a culture in which spontaneous violence is possible at the same time
  seems unsustainable. One possible explanation can be found in the forms of the novels themselves. In John Henry Days,
  there are three narratives which are retold by the characters. The novel itself, however, behaves as yet another
  retelling of these narratives. The novel presents its own version of the John Henry narrative, as well as the
  narrative of J. Sutter. There is, however, one important distinction to be made between Sutter’s narrative and those
  of the other two. At the outset of the novel, both John Henry and Meredith Hunter are already dead; during the
  retelling of their stories, it is already known that their deaths are inevitable. John Henry’s narrative is told in
  the past tense. The first line of his story begins, “The first blow shattered half the bones in the boy’s hand and the
  second shattered the other half” (Whitehead 83).
</p>

<p>
  Yet J’s narrative begins in the present with, “Now he blesses the certainty of airports” (Whitehead 9). Even the
  moment when his death is first reported, “After the killing is over, after the gunman has slid to the ground, after
  the gun smoke has dissipated into the invisible, the witnesses rouse themselves into this world again,” is told in the
  present tense (Whitehead 10). The moment that the exchange occurs between the past and present tenses is after the
  postal employees discuss the shooting in the DC bar. When the narrative next focuses on J and Pamela, it is in the
  past tense, beginning, “She wore blue. The song said never wear black, wear blue so she wore blue and they had a map.
  They walked down the road” (Whitehead 371). Importantly, it is the moment of retelling of his narrative that seals the
  exchange between his life and his narrative. Yet in between the beginning of the novel and this moment, there exists
  this tract of time told in the present tense that serves to propagate the exchange. A similar buildup towards the
  moment of the riot can be observed in The Day of the Locust. When the unfinished set of the Battle of Waterloo
  collapses, something in between the order of film production and the chaos of the riot: “The noise was terrific. Nails
  screamed with agony as they were pulled out of joists. The sound of ripping canvas was like that of little children
  whimpering. Lath and scantling snapped as though they were brittle bones” (West 100). Yet this catastrophe is more
  easily remedied than the riot, the only outcome being that “neither side won, and [the battle] would have to be fought
  over again the next day. Big losses, however, were sustained by the insurance company in workmen’s compensation” (West
  100).
</p>

<p>
  This gradual propagation towards violence rather than instantaneous precipitation implies a different model of
  culture, one where order is not the stable state, but merely a transient one that exists in metastability. In both
  novels, society tends constantly towards violence until the right collisions occur, and rioting breaks out. Culture
  demands sacrifice in order to sustain the continued existence of order, yet the exchanges made in the process are not
  perfect, and thus, with each sacrifice, something is lost in the process to entropy and the world is not restored to
  exactly the way it was before. In John Henry Days, it is meaning which is lost to entropic accumulation: each
  subsequent narrative promulgated by sacrifice holds less of what the individuals who died in the process were, and is
  held for an increasingly brief period of time by its audience. In The Day of the Locust, it is authenticity and vision
  which are lost as individuals are assimilated into culture. Just as J’s narrative shifts from the present to the past
  tense as his death becomes inevitable, this continual loss of authenticity of meaning, too, is presented as
  inevitable. Just as entropy must increase, so too the meaningfulness and value of these sacrifices must diminish.
