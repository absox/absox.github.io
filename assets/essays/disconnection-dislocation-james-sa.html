  Throughout Henry James’ “The Beast in the Jungle,” John Marcher feels the pressing need to distance himself from the
  world around him. He finds “what was present to him everywhere was that for a man who had known what he had known the
  world was vulgar and vain” (503). Marcher’s rejection of what he perceives around him as vulgar is not merely a
  product of his self-absorption, however, but is indicative of a wider dislocation between the two essential elements
  that shape the model of his consciousness. The narrative is focalized through his character, and his thoughts and
  perceptions are the driving force behind the story. Yet Marcher’s experience of his surroundings and his personal
  reflections are not meant to be discrete processes, but rather comprise a continuum of experience and assimilation. By
  turning away from the world, Marcher isolates one from the other. A similar dislocation also afflicts Ša in her
  “Impressions of an Indian Childhood” and “The School Days of an Indian Girl.” While Ša does not reject her
  surroundings, and is eager to learn and explore the world around her, she cannot quite connect the suffering of her
  people at the hands of white American society to the presence of the missionaries. She chooses to go east and attend
  school without fully comprehending the decision, and later finds herself torn between her heritage and education, and
  the institutional forces which physically displaced her family in the first place. Ultimately, as a result of their
  incomplete consciousnesses, both Marcher and Ša suffer and inflict pain upon those who care for them.

  Marcher’s forgetfulness upon re-encountering May Bartram at Weatherend, and his subsequent indifference to the
  realization that “he really didn’t remember the least thing about her” is illustrative of his condition (479). Upon
  first seeing her again, she is to him the pleasant thought of “the sequel of something of which he had lost the
  beginning,” (478). He rushes to speak to her, saying, “I met you years and years ago in Rome. I remember all about
  it,” yet this first detail is wrong, as are all the rest of the details which he attempts to recall, and when she
  corrects him, he is unperturbed, even pleased that she remembers (479). Importantly, it is not the case that Marcher
  does not recall her face; he merely cannot attribute any significance to their prior meeting. In this instance,
  Marcher is completely aware of having perceived her, yet a dislocation between that and the thoughts and memories
  which have been assimilated into his consciousness prevents him from recalling the details of their previous
  encounter.

  Ša, too, is seemingly forgetful when she pleads with her mother to allow her to go to school in the east. As a child,
  she witnesses her mother weeping, and begs to know why her mother is crying. Her mother tells her that it is because
  they have been driven from their lands, and that the deaths of her sister and uncle were the result of her family’s
  displacement, upon which Ša declares, “I hate the paleface that makes my mother cry!” (1087-1088). Ša is not only
  curious to see the world around her, but is also eager to hear of the legends of her elders, and seeing “a tattooed
  star upon the brow of the old warrior who was telling a story,” inquires as to their meaning (1090). Yet despite her
  eagerness to learn of the history and culture of her people, and what her mother tells her of the suffering that her
  family has endured firsthand, when the missionaries arrive, she is convinced to go by the interpreter who says to her,
  “Yes, little girl, the nice red apples are for those who pick them; and you will have a ride on the iron horse if you
  go with these good people” (1092). Just as Marcher cannot connect his perception of May with the significance of their
  past meeting, Ša cannot connect the arrival of the missionaries with her knowledge of the displacement and suffering
  endured by her family. Just as Marcher is unperturbed by his own forgetfulness, Ša is unimpeded by the warnings of her
  mother.
</p>

<p>
  Yet while it is possible to excuse Ša, who is only eight years old when she decides to go east, and still only fifteen
  when she chooses college against her mother’s will, for pursuing her childish curiosity about the world, John Marcher
  is far older; he was twenty-five at his first meeting with May Bartram, and eight years have passed when they meet
  again at Weatherend (1099, James 479). Yet this same disconnection between perception and thought that continues to
  impede Marcher in his interactions with May, and his anticipation of the event that he believes will define his life.
  It is almost comical that he does not remember the significance of his past meeting with May; she is the only person
  in the world whom he has told of his belief that some pivotal event in his life is yet to come (481). He perceives
  that “there was but one account of her that would have been true all the while and that she could give straight to
  nobody, least of all to [him],” yet just as he is unable to comprehend what he perceives when he sees her at
  Weatherend, he is again unable to connect his perceptions with his one great persistent thought of anticipation (487).
</p>

<p>
  But while it is possible for Ša to grow beyond her childish incomprehension, the pervasive force of white American
  society is perhaps a more permanent cause of her dislocation. While its role in displacing her family and Native
  Americans in general from their lands is a more directly physical kind of dislocation, it too in turn alters the
  relation between her thoughts and perceptions. The unrecognized relation between the missionaries who come offering
  education to the social institutions behind the physical dislocation of the Native Americans becomes more apparent
  when on the first day of classes, the girls are to have their hair cut. When Judéwin says to Ša, “We have to submit,
  because they are strong,” there is a clear parallel between the forceful seizure of land, and the education offered as
  recompense (1095). Though Ša says that she will not submit without struggle, inevitably her hair is cut, and she feels
  that “now [she] was only one of many little animals driven by a herder” (1096). Just as the displacement of her family
  served to physically dislocate them, Ša’s education also serves to dislocate her; returning home during the summer,
  she feels that “even nature seemed to have no place for [her]. [She] was neither a wee girl nor a tall one; neither a
  wild Indian nor a tame one” (1097). Though she did not recognize it as such at the time, choosing to go east with the
  missionaries in spite of what she had learned from her mother and from her elders was in essence a rejection of the
  collective thought and reflection of their culture. She is inexorably changed by her experience in the east, and when
  she again disobeys her mother and pursues a college career, she does so consciously (1099).

<p>
  As for John Marcher, while there is nothing that prevents him from being able to bridge his dislocation apart from his
  own continued insistence that he must be apart from the world, he, too, must suffer the consequences for what he
  failed to realize. Even while May is dying, so long as he holds the belief that yet “something’s to come,” he cannot
  recognize her love for him which he perceives before him for what it truly is (497). Yet once she has told him that
  the event has passed, saying to him before she dies, “What I long ago said is true. You’ll never know now, and I think
  you ought to be content,” he gives up the belief that he ought to be somehow apart from the rest of the world (499).
  After her death, “he walked about in an existence that had grown strangely more spacious, and, stopping fitfully in
  places where the undergrowth of life struck him as closer, asked himself yearningly, wondered secretly and sorely, if
  it would have lurked here or there” (502). It is only once he ceases to believe in the uniqueness of his life that he
  becomes more attuned to his surroundings, and finally is able to come to the conclusion for which he had been
  searching. When he passes by in the cemetery the man deeply stricken by loss, he is able to comprehend what he
  perceives: “He had seen outside of his life, not learned it within, the way a woman was mourned when she had been
  loved for herself: such was the force of his conviction of the meaning of the stranger’s face” (505). Marcher’s
  recognition of what ought to have been done is in contrast to his inability at Weatherend to recall the significance
  of his first meeting with May: he sees now that “the escape would have been to love her; then, then he would have
  lived” (506).
</p>

<p>
  In the end for Ša, though, there is no clear recognition of what ought to have been done. Though she could have
  conceded to her mother’s wish that she “give up [her] slow attempt to learn the white man’s ways, and be content to
  roam over the prairies and find [her] living upon wild roots,” the others of her age have all gone through the process
  of assimilation: “There were no more young braves in blankets and eagle plumes, nor Indian maids with prettily painted
  cheeks. They had gone three years to school in the East, and had become civilized” (1099, 1098). Nor can she overcome
  the dislocating force of American society through her personal successes in her education; at college, she feels
  “[she] had scarcely a real friend,” and even at the oratorical contest which she wins, there is still the ever present
  sign of prejudice in the form of the white flag with a derogatory drawing (1099-1100). Though “the white flag dropped
  out of sight, and the hands which furled it hung limp in defeat,” once alone, she has only the gnawing thought of her
  mother, “far away on the western plains, … holding a charge against [her]” (1100). Despite her success in the contest,
  the prejudice in the audience has not been overcome, merely put away, and in the process of her pursuing a college
  education, she further estranges herself from her family and heritage.
</p>

<p>
  It is the same kind of dislocation between perception and thought that initially prevent John Marcher and Zitkala Ša
  from realizing the significance of what they perceive before them: Ša in her choice to go east with the missionaries
  does not see the connection between the education and experiences which they offer and the subjugating force of
  American society which has displaced her family from their lands. Marcher in turn cannot see the connection between
  May Bartram and the event which he anticipates will change and define his life. Both suffer the consequences of the
  choice they made without realizing the significance, and in the process, inflict suffering onto those who care about
  them. Yet while Marcher is only dislocated by his own insistence, broader American institutional forces serve to
  dislocate Ša, not only physically from her family lands, but from the cultural history and collective reflection and
  thought of her family and people.
