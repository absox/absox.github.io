  In the wake of the release of the 2018 anime re-adaptation of Tanaka Yoshiki’s
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu" target="_blank"><i>Legend of the Galactic Heroes</i></a>
  (<i>LOGH</i> for short, <i>Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu</i> in the original Japanese), I had some musings on the similarities between
  <i>LOGH</i> and the 14th century Chinese classic, <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>, and what lessons these two works might
  have to teach when it comes to the art of crafting rational narrative. I highly recommend the original anime
  adaptation of <i>LOGH</i> to those who haven’t seen it, though watching it is a bit of a daunting task; the show is 110
  episodes long, and originally aired over the span of a decade from 1988 to 1997. <i>LOGH</i> chronicles the turning point
  in a centuries-long galactic conflict. Its grandeur in both vision and scope makes it one of the two contenders
  for my all-time favorite animated series (the other being <i><a href="#/media/shin-sekai-yori" target="_blank">From the New World</a></i>).

<p>
  In my earlier essay, <a href="#/essays/tensions-between-rationality-realism-and-humanity" target="_blank"><i>On the Tensions Between Rationality, Realism, and Humanity in HPMOR and Rationalist Fiction</i></a>,
  I examined the role of realism and human limitations in rationalist fiction. I argued that in
  Eliezer Yudkowsky’s <i>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</i> (which is a terrifically fun read, by the way),
  Harry is never put to any real test where he must weigh difficult choices against each other, and that this lack of
  difficult choices is a major shortcoming of the genre in general. <i>LOGH</i>, on the other hand, stands out to me because
  it does the opposite; rather than dodging difficult questions, its central theme is that the war between the
  Free Planets Alliance and Galactic Empire is not a conflict between good and evil, but between two opposing systems
  of virtue. Reinhard and Yang, the dual protagonists, are champions of these two systems and their respective virtues:
  Reinhard embodies the good that can be accomplished by the individual; the Empire which he rules is a totalitarian
  regime, yet is administered ably and justly, and through its unity, has brought peace and prosperity to much of the
  galaxy. Yang, on the other hand, is the ideal servant of democracy: he desires neither rank nor fame, though he
  achieves both as a result of his meritorious service. He is unwaveringly loyal to the ideals of liberty and
  representative government, unwilling to betray them even as the state which he serves betrays him: after Yang
  puts an end to Greenhill’s coup, the Alliance is in a precarious position; though, thanks to the efforts of Yang,
  they hold Iserlohn Fortress, their forces have been severely depleted by the infighting. Despite the increased danger
  from the Galactic Empire, Yang is recalled from the front by the Alliance government and ordered to stand trial for
  his actions during the insurrection (in order to capture the leaders of the coup, Yang was forced to destroy
  Heinessen’s planetary defense system) out of their fear that Yang seeks to seize political power for himself.
  Yang is again hindered by the government which he serves at the Battle of Vermillion: though he is within striking
  range of Reinhard’s flagship, he is ordered by the Alliance government to stand down his forces and surrender.
  This order comes because the Empire has captured the Alliance capital of Heinessen and forced its leadership
  into capitulation. Yet while the Empire cannot exist without Reinhard, the politicians of the Alliance are not
  indispensable to the continued existence of the republic; so long as the constitution and the rule of law endure,
  new leaders can be elected, and the institution of democracy can continue. The Alliance leadership act out of
  personal interest, and not with the interests of the Alliance itself at heart. Yang knows this, but in spite of
  this knowledge he still obeys, and relinquishes this hard-fought opportunity for victory, because for a military
  leader to countermand an order from the civilian government would be to undermine the principles of the democracy
  which he fights to uphold, no matter how extenuating the circumstances.

  To those who are familiar with eastern literature, <i>LOGH</i> (and much of Tanaka’s other work) is clearly influenced by
  the 14th century novel <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i> (<i>RTK</i> for short), which is a romanticized account
  of the Han Dynasty in the 2nd century AD, and the hundred years of civil war and chaos that followed. Liu Bei, scion
  of the royal house, and his retinue are the heroes of the story, on a noble but doomed quest to reunite the fractured
  realm, free the emperor from the clutches of a traitorous usurper (first Dong Zhuo, then Cao Cao), and restore the
  Han Dynasty to its former glory. Yet the central character of <i>RTK</i> is arguably not Liu Bei, but Zhuge Liang. Whereas
  Liu Bei is the ideal lord, exemplifying the Confucian values of a ruler through his benevolence and compassion,
  Zhuge Liang is the ideal minister, not only because of his great talents, but because of his enduring loyalty and
  sense of duty. Cosmic foreordination has doomed the Han Dynasty; the Mandate of Heaven has been lost, and this change
  in the cosmic trajectory is perceptible to the very wise (Constantine Tung writes at length on this topic in
  <a href="https://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/61400.pdf" target="_blank"><i>Cosmic Foreordination and Human Commitment: The Tragic Volition in Three Kingdoms</i></a>).
  Liu Bei and his brothers encounter many scholars at Longzhong who acknowledge the righteousness of their ambitious,
  yet refuse to join them, recognizing that Heaven has doomed the heroes to fail. Zhuge Liang, too, is aware that if
  he joins Liu Bei, he goes to his own demise, and is conflicted for a time between two systems of virtue: his
  Daoist sensibilities urge him to live in accordance to Heaven’s will, but his Confucian sense of duty obliges
  him to act. His ultimate choice to serve Liu Bei is the defining moment of <i>RTK</i> and is enshrined as the ultimate
  example of duty: as for the sake of his duty, he is willing to oppose even Heaven itself. His loyalty is tested when
  Liu Bei is on his deathbed in Baidicheng, having lost the battle of Xiaoting. Liu Shan, Liu Bei’s eldest son, is not
  fit to rule, and so, Liu Bei offers the kingdom of Shu to Zhuge Liang. Yet Zhuge Liang must refuse, as his goal is
  not merely to reunite the realm, but to restore the Han; to accept rulership of Shu would be to become merely another
  among the many usurpers, and to undermine the dynasty which he wishes to serve. He, too, is hindered by the government
  which he serves, and some of these scenes are clearly mirrored in <i>LOGH</i>: during his second Northern Expedition, after
  a series of victories against Wei, Zhuge Liang is recalled to Chengdu by imperial order; rumors have been circulating
  among Shu officials of his disloyalty (later revealed to be the work of Sima Yi’s agent). Yet while Zhuge Liang’s
  loyalty is clearly not in doubt to any reasonable observer, Liu Shan is incapable of handling the internal politics
  of his kingdom, and as a result, a precious opportunity to press the advantage goes to waste.

  Other characters in <i>RTK</i> are also forced to choose between one virtue and another. Guan Yu, when he allows
  Cao Cao to escape from Huarongdao after the battle of Red Cliff, chooses honor over duty. Though his duty to Liu Bei
  and to the Han dynasty compels him to kill Cao Cao, he instead chooses to repay the hospitality that Cao Cao had once
  shown him; after Liu Bei’s defeat at Xiaopei and the subsequent separation of the brothers, Cao Cao had not only
  spared Guan Yu’s life, but bestowed gifts upon him (the legendary Red Hare among them), and ultimately allowed him
  to rejoin Liu Bei. Ultimately, Liu Bei himself chooses brotherhood over the empire; upon obtaining Yizhou from
  Liu Zhang, all the prerequisites for the Longzhong plan, Zhuge Liang’s proposed grand strategy for reunifying the
  empire, have been met. With the two provinces of Yi and Jing, it is now possible for Liu Bei to launch a northern
  expedition for the conquest of the Central Plains, provided that peace is maintained with Wu in the east. Yet his
  desire for vengeance for the deaths of his brothers overtakes his desire to restore the Han, and ignoring Zhuge
  Liang’s advice, embarks eastward on a disastrous campaign that ends in his demise.

  In <i>LOGH</i>, however, the dichotomies are not quite so clear, nor are there clear heroes and villains. Though Reinhard
  is an autocrat, he ultimately concedes that for his empire to outlive him, its institutions cannot rely on the
  genius of one man in their day-to-day proceedings. He gathers many talented subordinates, and routinely relies upon
  them to implement his plans. Though Yang is the champion of liberty and the collective will, perhaps he alone is
  responsible for sustaining the continued existence of the Free Planets Alliance, repeatedly winning battles against
  nigh-impossible odds through his tactical prowess. Ironically, it is democracy which must rely upon the genius of
  one man for its survival. Moreover, while Reinhard has inarguably improved the lives of his imperial subjects
  through his enlightened administration, the Alliance for which Yang fights falls far short of his democratic
  ideals: the Alliance government is rife with corruption and misrule, as its politicians serve their personal aims,
  rather than the national interest (coincidentally, this makes <i>LOGH</i> a narrative that is increasingly relevant to the
  current global geopolitical climate, as the institutional rot plaguing the United States and other liberal democracies
  becomes apparent and totalitarianism in China, Russia, and the world in general is seemingly on the rise). The grand
  questions posed are whether it is better to live under an enlightened dictatorship than a corrupt democracy, and
  whether a democracy which has outlived its purpose ought to continue at all. Francis Fukuyama, in his 1992 book,
  <i>The End of History and the Last Man</i>, argued that there can be no further progression beyond the liberal
  democracy that we know in our society. Yet in <i>LOGH</i>, just as empires fall into decadence and decline, and are
  ultimately subject to upheaval, democracies are equally subject to the erosion of their values by moral decay.
  Indeed, the Galactic Empire itself was born from the death of the Galactic Federation at the hands of Rudolf
  von Goldenbaum.
</p>
<p>
  But just as <i>LOGH</i> does not fear to consider the monolithic issues of the nature of governance and morality, it
  doesn’t pretend that it knows all the answers, or even that there exists any singular answer to the questions at
  hand. Episodes which explore mankind’s history in the galaxy (e.g. Episode 40: <i>Julian’s Journey, Mankind’s Journey</i>)
  ultimately only encourage the viewer to contemplate these issues for themselves. Yang, who is himself a historian,
  does not believe his own judgment to be the final arbitration on these matters; indeed, by consciously avoiding the
  path that led Goldenbaum to go from servant of the state to its dictator, Yang refuses to let his opinion become
  arbitration. To revisit the topic of rational and rationalist fiction: though rationalist fiction is defined as
  fiction in which the reader can reach the same conclusions as the characters using information provided in the text,
  perhaps there’s something to be said for rational work that is constructed such that there isn’t necessarily a
  unique solution for the reader to deduce (after all, what’s “optimal” even through the objective lens of
  utilitarianism is really only optimal with respect to a specific objective function).

<p>
  As a last and somewhat tangential aside and addendum, I wanted to remark on Zhuge Liang’s defiance of cosmic will in
  the line of duty. As someone who grew up in the United States and had a somewhat Americentric education, it astonished
  me when I first understood that Zhuge Liang, in choosing to serve Liu Bei, was making a conscious decision to oppose
  the will of Heaven. In the western Classical tradition, defiance of the gods not only invariably ends in catastrophe,
  but is regarded as immoral, or at the very least unworthy of imitation. In Sophocles’ <i>Ajax</i>, the armor of
  Achilles is to be granted to the greatest warrior now remaining among the Achaeans. A contest is set up in order to
  determine who the greatest warrior is, and Odysseus is determined to be the victor. Ajax is displeased with this
  outcome, and decides to kill Menelaus and Agamemnon, who have shamed him by declaring Odysseus, and not him, the
  greatest warrior. Before he can do so, however, Athena afflicts him with madness, and he kills not Menelaus and
  Agamemnon, but a herd of cattle. Odysseus himself later offends Poseidon, and thus, even with the protection of the
  goddess Athena, is subjected to ten years of trials and wandering, and the loss of all his companions before he is
  able to return at last to Ithaca. Hubris is invariably portrayed as hamartia, leading to suffering and downfall.
  This is no different in <i>RTK</i>, as the heroes who seek to oppose cosmic foreordination and restore the Han embark on
  a journey that ends in failure and demise. Yet whereas defiance of the gods is vilified in Greek drama, Zhuge Liang
  is celebrated for his struggle against the cosmic will. Perhaps what separates Zhuge Liang’s decision from the hubris
  of the Greeks is his selflessness: though he defies the will of Heaven, it is not for personal gain, but in service
  to the realm; it is a decision made to fulfill his duty to the Han.
