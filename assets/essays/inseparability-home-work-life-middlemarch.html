  In <i>Middlemarch</i> by George Eliot, work is more than merely a means to financial gain. Work serves as the focal
  point of a character’s energies, and financial necessity does not always necessarily play a part in a character’s
  motivation for work. Casaubon, who is independently wealthy, dedicates his life to academic study and his book, <i>The
  Key to All Mythologies</i>, and Lydgate, though he must make a living off his medical practice, has greater ambitions
  of not only treating the sick, but bringing reform to the practice of medicine in general. Toward this end, he takes
  no salary for his management of the New Hospital in order to free his judgment from outside influence, saying that, “I
  should be a base truckler if I allowed any consideration of personal comfort to hinder me” (Eliot 440). Yet Lydgate’s
  attempts to prevent personal considerations from interfering with his professional judgment are ultimately futile
  because in Middlemarch, work exceeds the conventional boundaries of work life; work permeates and connects the
  professional and personal spheres of characters’ lives.

  In order to examine work, a definition of what constitutes work must be established, as well as a view of the aspects
  of work. Conventionally, an individual works to contribute either a product or a service to society, and is
  compensated in return for their work. Yet this definition is perhaps too narrow for a view of work which occupies an
  expanded domain beyond the simple exchange of services or goods for money. Casaubon’s research, which he is not
  attempting to market to a body of consumers, would fall beneath the notice of such a definition. Dorothea’s moments
  where she chooses to take incisive action in order to benefit others, too, would go unnoticed. Perhaps a more suitable
  description of work would be of actions to effect change with clear objectives and motivation. This definition
  dissects work into three constituent components of action, objective, and motive which can be examined in turn, while
  still enclosing all aspects of the conventional, monetary view of work.

  Once specific cases are examined under this methodology, the inexorable link between the professional and personal
  realms which work provides becomes apparent. Fred Vincy, as he trains under Caleb Garth to become a land agent, has
  the singular end goal of making a decent station in life for himself. Yet his motivations for taking on this work are
  twofold; he wishes not only to make a good living for himself, but also to demonstrate to Mary Garth, whom he wishes
  to take as his wife, that he is worthy of her. Fortunately for Fred, his professional motivation of making a living,
  and his personal motivation of his desire for Mary are aligned which each other, and they do not ultimately compromise
  his resolve to accomplish his work. Though there are obstacles which he must overcome, Fred is able to gradually work
  through them: though he initially failed his university examinations, Fred attempts them anew, and takes his
  Bachelor’s degree. Though his penmanship is poor and not up to Mr. Garth’s standards at first, he had “by dint of
  severe practice nearly mastered the defects of his handwriting” (Eliot 670). However, Fred is aided by Mr. Farebrother
  twice: first, when he returns from university with his degree, and is uncertain whether or not he should take up
  religious work, Farebrother urges him not to take up a path for which he is unsuited, and again, when he “had been
  rewarding resolution by a little laxity,” Farebrother warns him that if Fred falls into his old ways, Farebrother will
  court Mary himself, renewing Fred’s resolve. “‘I will try to be worthy,’ [Fred says to Farebrother], breaking off
  before he could say ‘of you as well of her’” (Eliot 676). Once Fred gains this conviction, he does not waver from it.
</p>

<p>
  Just the opposite effect, however, can be observed when a character’s motivations are not in line with each other.
  Before Fred is disappointed at the last moment in his expectations from his uncle Featherstone, he entertains notions
  of being master of Stone Court and a land-owning gentleman. He failed his university education and continually accrues
  debts, yet does not think that this will be of much consequence, as he will soon be granted, through his expectations,
  with all the income and leisure time which he requires. Yet though Fred still had his deep affection for Mary, as he
  was, his vision of being a man of leisure and indiscretion could not be reconciled with a life with her. Mary states,
  even while Fred is on the path to self-improvement, that “‘I could not love a man who is ridiculous,’” and that “‘Fred
  has sense and knowledge enough to make him respectable, if he likes’” (Eliot 516). Perhaps it is only as a result of
  his failed expectations from Featherstone that Fred is finally able to accomplish what he wishes. As a result of
  receiving nothing, Fred abandons his incompatible view of how he will make a living for himself, and slowly aligns his
  professional motivation with his personal goals.

  Dorothea’s marriage to Edward Casaubon can also be examined as a cased of misaligned work. Dorothea has a great desire
  to better the lives of others, and to aid them in whatever way she can. At the outset of the novel, Eliot draws
  parallels between Dorothea and Saint Theresa of Avila. But while Theresa’s life of courage, spiritual reform, and
  martyrdom can be clearly defined as work, Dorothea, while possessing ideas of making grand impressions on the lives of
  others, lacks action and objectives. The leisurely life of the landed gentry does not suit her, and though she
  occupies some of her time by drawing up plans for cottages for the tenants of her uncle’s land, she still does not
  quite have more than an amorphous involvement in the realization of these plans (Eliot 32). Her marriage to Casaubon
  is one way in which she seeks to fill the gap, telling herself that “‘I should know everything then,’” and that “‘It
  would be like marrying Pascal’” (Eliot 29). Yet her marriage cannot fill this gap in her experience because Casaubon
  himself works in vain. His theory of Christian syncretism has already been explored by others, and <i>The Key to All
  Mythologies</i> will not contribute anything new. In truth, her marriage fulfills neither her personal desire for
  devotion, nor her wish to be a positive force in the world. It is not until Dorothea takes it upon herself to mend
  Tertius and Rosamond’s relationship that a certain clarity of intention arises in her, where Dorothea understands what
  she must do, and sets out with a “clearness and intensity of mental action” (Eliot 793). As a result of her
  intervention, Lydgate and Rosamond are reconciled, yet this is only possible when Dorothea has her objectives and
  motivations in line with her actions.

<p>
  Bulstrode too is a case of conflicted motivation. Though he is aware of the conflict, he attempts to rationalize
  rather than reconcile. Bulstrode, using his wealth and influence as a banker, seeks “to gain as much power as
  possible, that he might use it for the glory of God” (Eliot 155-156). Yet Bulstrode, on multiple occasions, encounters
  situations where he must choose between morality and material gain, and each time, chooses to sacrifice morality,
  offering some justification. His first moral failure is at the pawnbroker’s shop, where he is complicit in the sale of
  stolen goods. He then marry Mrs. Dunkirk, and keeps secret from her the discovery of her daughter, Sarah Dunkirk, Will
  Ladislaw’s mother, so that he might gain all of her property through his marriage. When Bulstrode allows Raffles to
  die, he does so in much the same way as he disinherits Sarah Dunkirk. “Bulstrode had never said to himself beforehand,
  ‘The daughter shall not be found’ – nevertheless when the moment came he kept her existence hidden” (Eliot 618). He
  does not premeditate the death of Raffles, yet when the opportunity is presented to him to be careless with Raffles’
  life, he willfully takes it. Bulstrode makes himself a hypocrite, “a man whose desires had been stronger than his
  theoretic beliefs, and who had gradually explained the gratification of his desires into satisfactory agreement with
  those beliefs” (Eliot 619). Though “he believed without effort in the peculiar work of grace within him, and in the
  signs that God intended him for special instrumentality,” he only adopts this belief, and his speciously fervent
  Evangelicism so that his conscience might bear the conflict between his motivations (Eliot 616).
</p>

<p>
  It is clear that there is a strong interplay between the professional and personal aspects of work. Perhaps the
  uncompromising nature of this connection is illustrated by the fates of characters who futilely strive to fabricate a
  separation between their professional and personal lives. Bulstrode, though for a time, is able to conceal his past
  from the Middlemarch society, cannot keep his sordid professional life separate from his personal present, despite the
  measures he has taken to ensure secrecy, and the evangelical persona which he has adopted. John Raffles, the sole man
  who knew the truth of Bulstrode’s affairs, returns, and causes Bulstrode’s disgrace and exile from Middlemarch.
</p>

<p>
  Yet while Bulstrode’s fate can be argued as simply a moral resolution for his past wrongs, Lydgate, in spite of his
  noble intentions, fails in his attempts to maintain boundaries between the professional and personal as well. He, too,
  departs from Middlemarch, and because he cannot reconcile his professional aspirations of medical reform with his
  personal life with Rosamond, ultimately, “he always regarded himself as a failure: he had not done what he had once
  meant to do” (Eliot 835).
</p>

<p>
  Lydgate has two primary objectives in his life: that of medical reform, and that of Rosamond, whom he marries. His
  marriage to Rosamond is particularly incongruous in its impetuousness, and is reminiscent of the Lydgate’s earlier
  infatuation with a French actress whom he had met in Paris. She killed her husband onstage, yet made it appear as an
  accident. As a result, Lydgate swore that “he would take a strictly scientific view of women, entertaining no
  expectations, but such as were justified beforehand” (Eliot 153). Yet when Lydgate meets Rosamond, he forgets this vow
  entirely, as well as the practical nature of his limited resources. He refuses to make compromises in their living,
  and though the debt they accumulate interferes with Lydgate’s running of business, and ultimately leads to his
  entanglement with Bulstrode’s disgrace, he does not inform Rosamond of his financial troubles, hoping to shield her,
  his personal aspiration, from the troubles of his professional life, though his two troubles are interconnected.
  Perhaps the greatest statement of his marriage with his professional life comes from Rosamond herself, when she states
  that “‘Do you know, Tertius, that I often wish you had not been a medical man’” (Eliot 458).
</p>

<p>
  In his medical practice, Lydgate refuses to allow financial, or professional considerations to interfere with his
  plans of reform. While his ideas are rational, and Lydgate, with his superior knowledge of medicine, is able to cure
  what were thought to be hopeless cases, he often goes against his ability to make a living. For instance, in order to
  reduce unnecessary prescriptions, he wishes to deincentivize doctors by removing them from the sale and dispensing of
  medicines. Yet a great part of doctors’ incomes are made from the sale of medicine, and they become opposed to not
  only this idea, but Lydgate’s reforms in general, though on the surface, “Neither Dr. Sprague nor Dr. Minchin said
  that he disliked Lydgate's knowledge, or his disposition to improve treatment: what they disliked was his arrogance,
  which nobody felt to be altogether deniable” (Eliot 454). “There was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical
  man in the town to become a visitor at the Fever Hospital.” Because Lydgate is unwilling to make professional
  concessions, he handicaps himself in his personal endeavors. Furthermore, he refuses to take a salary for the
  management of the hospital, thinking that he would be obliged to Bulstrode, who provides the majority of its funding.
  Yet despite these measures, he cannot help but feel Bulstrode’s influence when he is called upon to decide whether
  Farebrother or Tyke will take the position of chaplain at the hospital, and in the end, chooses Tyke, the candidate
  proposed to him by Bulstrode. “For the first time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of small
  social conditions, and their frustrating complexity” (Eliot 180). Yet he views them as a nuisance, external to his
  work, and thinks, “He would not have cared a rotten nut for the banker’s friendship or enmity. What he really cared
  for was a medium for his work.”
</p>

<p>
  Lydgate’s failure was in viewing the professional and personal as separate spheres, rather than a single
  interconnected medium for his work. By dividing his motivations against each other, he handicaps his own progress. In
  Middlemarch, work is only successful if properly aligned with both professional and personal motivations. Fred Vincy
  ultimately is able to align his personal desire for Mary with a professional desire for productivity. Yet Lydgate and
  Bulstrode, who try to maintain a separation between their work and their personal lives, find that in Middlemarch,
  this is a futile endeavor, and are forced into exile.
