  Opinions on <i>From the New World</i> (<i>Shin Sekai Yori</i> in the original Japanese) are somewhat polarized.
  The show first aired in Fall 2012 and is an adaptation of Kishi Yusuke’s Taishou-winning novel; gradually, it’s risen
  from obscurity to become somewhat of a cult classic, by way of YouTube anime content creators recommending it to
  their audiences or through word of mouth (I myself have proselytized several of my friends, and I hope to convince
  you, noble reader, in turn).

  <i>Shin Sekai Yori</i> is set a thousand years in the future, in a world where humans have had telekinetic powers
  for hundreds of years. The emergence of these abilities has had its impact on history; centuries of conflict have
  shaped both human society and humans themselves into something different from what they once were. The story is a
  slow burner that follows Saki, our protagonist, from her childhood to her late twenties as she tries to understand
  the society she lives in, and her own role within it. Through her eyes, <i>Shin Sekai Yori</i> attempts to explore
  the essential nature of humanity; though the world and its people have transformed, something familiar and essential
  to being human still remain. This is a vast and difficult idea, and I think that Shin Sekai Yori gives it the
  treatment and thought that it deserves.

  That’s not to say that <i>Shin Sekai Yori</i> is perfect. The slow pacing isn’t for everyone. The animation was done
  by an inexperienced team on a shoestring budget. The show was a financial failure because of its lack of mass appeal.
  Yet the most common criticisms that I’ve seen – that the show is too predictable, or that its characters aren’t
  distinctive enough – miss the point of <i>Shin Sekai Yori</i> entirely; if you were to grade its animation,
  surprising plot twists, and character design each in a vacuum on a scale from 0 to 10, then perhaps the show is
  indeed, from this perspective, a mediocre work of post-apocalyptic sci-fi. But <i>Shin Sekai Yori</i> is certainly more than
  the sum of its parts; they combine to create an atmosphere that is at once both foreign and surreal, yet retains
  that essential component which remains familiar and human.
