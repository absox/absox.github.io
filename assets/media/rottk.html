  <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i> is one of the Four Great Classics of Chinese literature (alongside Water Margin,
  Journey to the West, and Dream of the Red Chamber). Written in the 14th century, it is a partly historical, partly
  fictional account of the tumultuous end of the Han Dynasty, and is one of the most widely read literary works in
  east Asia. Generations of politicians, military strategists, and writers have been inspired by the values and ideals
  espoused within. The original OVA adaptation of Tanaka Yoshiki's <i>Legend of the Galactic Heroes</i> is one of the
  classics of the animated medium, and my personal favorite television series of all time; it too is heavily inspired
  by <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>.

  Zhuge Liang, styled Kongming (诸葛亮, 字孔明), is the central character of the novel, though he does not appear
  until midway through. Nicknamed the Sleeping Dragon (卧龙), he claims to have talent comparable to the sage-minister
  Guan Zhong, and the ancient general Yue Yi. Yet he lives in seclusion at Longzhong, answering only to a worthy lord.
  Just as Alexandre Dumas' <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> truly begins after Edmond Dantès escapes the Chateau d'If,
  <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i> truly begins when Kongming finally chooses to leave his retreat and exert his talents.

  If you're interested in politics, war, and history, and in the struggles of talented heroes with lofty ideals as they
  contend for the fate of a fractured realm, this is the seminal novel, an unparallled and expansive masterwork.
  If reading in English, I recommend the unabridged Moss Roberts translation (which comes in two volumes -
  <a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520224787/" target="_blank">Volume 1</a>,
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520225031/" target="_blank">Volume 2</a>).
  I first read the <a href="http://www.threekingdoms.com" target="_blank">C. H. Brewitt-Taylor
  translation</a> annotated with comments from many internet readers over spring break of my junior year at Hopkins, back in 2015.
  In the words of one user <i>guanping</i>, "Welcome. Welcome to the best book in the world."
