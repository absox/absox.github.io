  The anime adaptation of Tanaka Yoshiki’s <i>Legend of the Galactic Heroes</i> is one of the classics of the medium.
  The work, clearly influenced by the 14th century Ming Dynasty classic novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms
  (I explore comparisons between the two in greater detail in my essay
  <a href="#/essays/logh-rotk-and-rational-fiction-in-general" target="_blank">Opposing Systems of Virtue: Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Rational Fiction</a>,
  though beware of spoilers), tells the story of the centuries-long conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and
  the Galactic Empire as they vie for dominance over humanity in the Milky Way. This clash is both military and
  ideological; Yang and Reinhardt, the dual protagonists of <i>LOGH</i>, are paragons of their respective ideals,
  and champions of their respective societal philosophies; from their perspectives, the narrative ponders such vast
  ideas as the value of individual freedoms, the purpose of government, and the role of the individual in society.
  <i>LOGH</i> is expansive in both vision and scope; its lofty ambitions are reflected in its length: the anime is 110
  episodes long, and originally aired over the span of a decade from 1988 to 1997, whereas the novel from which the
  show was adapted was published in 10 volumes.

  The battles themselves are somewhat of a lost opportunity; to those familiar with military history, the tactics used
  by the admirals of both fleets are oddly reminiscent of Napoleonic land warfare. Hardly ever is the third dimension
  used to good effect. Moreover, there is a certain lack of subtlety endemic to Tanaka’s work; <i>LOGH</i> suffers somewhat
  from this, as does Arslan Senki. There is also somewhat of a tendency to tell, rather than show the viewer the
  important ideas of the narrative: Yang and Reinhardt spend a great deal of their screen time explaining their
  rationale to other characters, and the narration itself often states outright the significance of certain events,
  even when it could be reasonably understood by an intelligent viewer. Yet I think that it was worth watching every
  minute of <i>LOGH</i>; Tanaka dares to attempt to convey a grand concept through a grand narrative, and I think he largely
  succeeds in doing so.
