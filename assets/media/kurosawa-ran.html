  Akira Kurosawa's <i>Ran</i> (乱, translit. Mandarin: "luàn", lit. "chaos") is one of his most highly regarded films.
  It adapts the plot and narrative structure of Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i> to the Sengoku Jidai: in place of Lear
  and his daughters Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia, we have the daimyō Ichimonji Hidetora and his three sons, Taro, Jiro,
  and Saburo. This transposition somewhat intensifies certain aspects of <i>King Lear</i>'s moral conceit. Hidetora's
  sons neglect their formal duties under filial piety, just as he abdicates his own responsibilities as lord and father.

  Nihilistic interpretations of <i>King Lear</i> came into vogue in the 20th century, but while neither the stage
  production nor its film adaptation affirms a strong moral conclusion, to me it is at least clear that an ambiguous
  morality is not equivalent to a lack thereof. <i>Ran</i> is a cautionary tale about seeking privilege without
  responsibility, believing substanceless claims to moral superiority, and the banal yet fragile nature of what is truly
  good. Kurosawa's direction relies more heavily upon nonverbal techniques than Shakespeare's dialogue, and it is
  largely for his mastery of visual storytelling that the film is so highly regarded by critics.
