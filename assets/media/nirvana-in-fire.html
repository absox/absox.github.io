  <i>Nirvana in Fire (琅琊榜 Lángyá bǎng)</i>, adapted from Hai Yan's novel of the same name, is perhaps not only one of the greatest Chinese television dramas,
  but also one of the finest works of plot-driven storytelling in recent history.
  Set in the Southern and Northern Dynasties' state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_dynasty" target="_blank">Liang</a>,
  the protagonist, Mei Changsu, a physically frail and sickly scholar, journeys to the capital of Jinling (present-day Nanjing)
  amidst the struggle for succession between the Crown Prince (Xiao Jingxuan, Prince of Xian) and his 4th brother (Xiao Jinghuan, Prince of Yu).
  Praised as the Divine Talent (麒麟才子 Qílín cáizǐ) by the titular (in the original Chinese) Langya hall, the two princes both seek to engage
  his services as a strategist. Yet unbeknownst to them, Mei Changsu's true identity is Lin Shu, a retainer of the late Prince of Qi, the former (but now-deceased) crown prince.
  His true motivation for entering into the power struggle is to avenge his former lord and comrades in the Chiyan Army,
  both falsely accused of treason.

  The most direct comparisons in Western media are <i>Game of Thrones</i> and <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>.
  <i>Nirvana in Fire</i> is similar to both in theme as well as in storytelling focus, yet is somewhat more focused in scope
  and premise than either. It combines reasonably good acting with the well-crafted political intrigue of early-season
  <i>Game of Thrones</i>. While its dialogue is not as elegant as George R. R. Martin's prose, its schemes run deeper,
  pitting characters against each other intelligently in a many-faceted game. Pacing is occasionally lethargic
  throughout the 54-episode runtime, yet the first few episodes are almost perfect. Despite its modest budget compared
  to Western productions, <i>Nirvana in Fire</i> also manages to outdo <i>Game of Thrones</i> in the direction of
  its climactic battle sequence.
