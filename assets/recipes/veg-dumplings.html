<p>Feeds four. Masses and volumes are approximate and may require adjustment. This is a vegetarian dumpling recipe of
  my own invention, refined through trial and error. This version has proven most popular with my friends, even those
  who eat meat.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<h4>Wrappers</h4>
<ul>
  <li>About two cups of flour</li>
  <li>Water, the exact quantity may vary depending on conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Filling:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>2 packs of dried pressed tofu (five spice flavor)</li>
  <li>3-4 medium zucchini</li>
  <li>Half a nappa cabbage.</li>
  <li>Quarter pound of shiitake mushrooms.</li>
  <li>Ginger, one tablespoon, adjust to taste.</li>
  <li>Soy sauce, a liberal quantity, adjust to taste.</li>
  <li>Sesame oil, a generous drizzle.</li>
  <li>Two whole eggs (can be omitted for vegans).</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Mix flour and water until you have a soft, homogeneous dough. Knead for at least 15 minutes, then cover with
    plastic wrap and let rest while you prepare the other ingredients.
  </li>
  <li>Finely mince the filling ingredients. Combine in a bowl and mix well.</li>
  <li>Generous flour a surface and roll dumpling skins thinly with a rolling pin (dowel, no handles, untapered).</li>
  <li>Fill dumplings, making sure skins are rolled thinly, and each dumpling is filled to capacity to avoid too thick of
    a skin at any point. This takes some manual dexterity, and the skill to do so can't really be conveyed through text.

  </li>
  <li>Boil in water in a pot without crowding, around 3 minutes after reaching a rolling boil.</li>
  <li>Serve and enjoy. I recommend
